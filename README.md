# Syntax-Analyzer-using-Java
This project is based on Syntax Analyzer. It is a part of the compiler which 
converts Jack language into VM code. A Syntax Analyzer can parse Jack 
programmes in accordance with the Jack language and generate an 
XML(extensible markup language) file that uses marked-up text to display the 
program's structure.<br></br>
This syntax analyzer has mainly three modules:<br></br>
   1.JackAnalyzer.java which is the top-most/ main module that drives the process.<br></br>
   2.JackTokenizer.java which converts the jack program into a list of tokens.<br></br>
   3.CompilationEngine.java or parser verifies that the string can be the grammar for 
the source language. It detects and reports any syntax errors and produces a 
parse tree from which intermediate code can be generated.
